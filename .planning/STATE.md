# State: Clarity Pack

**Initialized:** 2026-05-07
**Last updated:** 2026-05-07

## Project Reference

**What:** A Paperclip plugin (`clarity-pack`) that adds four user-facing surfaces (Reader view, Situation Room, Daily Bulletin, Employee Chat) and one Editor-Agent on top of an unmodified Paperclip install, for a solo founder running Paperclip's agent-driven org chart on the live BEAAA insurance project.

**Core Value:** Zero rabbit-holes - every cross-reference resolved inline, every blocker chain transitively flattened to a single named human action, every deliverable previewed in place.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 - Pre-Install Safety. Build snapshot/restore/smoke-test/runbook/pre-flight-gate so any clarity-pack action against live BEAAA has bounded blast radius, before any plugin code ships.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 - Pre-Install Safety
**Plan:** Not started (awaiting `/gsd:plan-phase 1`)
**Status:** Roadmap created; planning pending
**Progress:** [          ] 0/5 phases complete

## Accumulated Context

### Locked Decisions (carry across phases)

1. **Plugin form factor** - one TypeScript package, one manifest, one UI bundle exporting many React components by name, one out-of-process Node worker over JSON-RPC stdio. Not four plugins per surface.
2. **Hybrid chat persistence** - real-time UI but durable as ordinary `public.issue_comments`; attachments as Paperclip work-products. Single source of truth = `issue_comments`.
3. **Editor-Agent governance parity** - declared in manifest `agents[]`, reconciled per-company via `ctx.agents.managed.reconcile()`. Inherits Paperclip heartbeat + budget caps + pause/terminate + audit log automatically. No custom `setInterval` daemon.
4. **Default landing = Paperclip classic dashboard** - Clarity views are opt-in clicks, never overrides.
5. **v1 audience = Eric on BEAAA only** - Clipmart submission deferred; multi-tenant work out of scope.
6. **Bulletin cadence = 06:30 ET scheduled** + Situation Room on-view recompute every 60s (configurable via `instanceConfigSchema`).
7. **Pre-install backup + rollback discipline before any production action** - Phase 1 ships snapshot/restore scripts and a working rollback drill before any feature code touches BEAAA. Bookended-by-snapshots rule applies forever.
8. **Stack pins are forced by the plugin contract** - React 19 (peer-only, never bundled), TypeScript ^5.7.3, esbuild ^0.27.3, ESM-only, Node >=20, shadcn `new-york`/neutral/lucide. Tailwind inherited from host CSS.
9. **Paperclip default branch is `master`, not `main`** - all doc URLs and CI references must use `/blob/master/...`.
10. **Plugin UI runs as same-origin trusted JS** (not iframed) - manifest capabilities gate worker RPC but NOT UI HTTP fetch. Day-1 mitigations (bridge-only, ESLint rule on raw fetch, pinned lockfile, no postinstall scripts) ship in Phase 2.

### Open Todos

- [ ] Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to decompose Phase 1 into executable plans.
- [ ] Resolve 3 conflicts in Phase 2 SPEC.md (slot identity, migrations, refresh cadence) before Phase 2 planning.
- [ ] Verify install command form (`pnpm paperclipai plugin install` vs `pnpm paperclipai install`) by running `pnpm paperclipai plugin --help` against a fresh clone in Phase 2.0 smoke spike.
- [ ] Verify `usePluginStream` direct host-event subscription (for `issue.comment.created`) before Phase 4 design is locked.
- [ ] Verify `comment.updated` event existence in PLUGIN_SPEC §16 before Phase 4 (currently absent in documented minimum set; chat edits modeled as append-with-supersedes).
- [ ] Verify cron timezone interpretation in PLUGIN_SPEC §17 before Phase 3 (use worker-managed `next_due_at` regardless).

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-07 - Project initialized; PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, research/ (SUMMARY, ARCHITECTURE, FEATURES, STACK, PITFALLS) drafted; ROADMAP.md and STATE.md created.

**Next session resume point:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1 (Pre-Install Safety) plan decomposition.
